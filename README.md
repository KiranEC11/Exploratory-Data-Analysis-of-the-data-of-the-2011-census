We have 2011 census data. In my exploratory data analysis, I have asked 10 reasonably relevant questions and tried to find answers to them.
I haven't included too many data visualisation techniques here. I have used simple Python code to extract the relevant features from the data. You can use various visualisatvisualizationion techniques for viewing and understanding these results.
